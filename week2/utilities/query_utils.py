# expects clicks and impressions to be in the row
# Fixing the incorrect assumption
# Letâ€™s illustrate by comparing a popular query with a much less popular query. 
# For a popular head query, you might have the same query millions of times per day compared to a long tail query that executes just a hundred times. 
# If the top document on the long tail query gets clicked 99 out of 100 times, that seems like a way stronger signal of relevance than a head query that gets clicked 1000 times out of million, 
# and yet, if we just pass in clicks alone our model is only going to learn that unadjusted bigger numbers are better.
# Fix: In  \`create_prior_queries_from_group\`, change to \`click_prior_query += "%s^%.3f  " % (item.doc_id, item.clicks/item.num_impressions)\`
